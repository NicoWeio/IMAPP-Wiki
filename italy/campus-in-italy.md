# Campus in Italy

* Unibo isn't really a campus university, but the buildings you will (probably) have lectures in are close to each other:
  * [Via Irnerio, 46](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WJm1ikeRy2BX1LpdA) (physics)
  * [Via Francesco Selmi, 2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AcWPRWWhEwLFi2YF6) (chemistry)
  * [Piazza di Porta San Donato, 5](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2rzFZbjFcXSyLcpM6) (maths)
  * and, occasionally, other ones in the area
* Food options:
  * university canteens: [https://www.er-go.it/esplora-i-benefici/benefici-erogati-da-er.go/ristorazione/bologna](https://www.er-go.it/esplora-i-benefici/benefici-erogati-da-er.go/ristorazione/bologna)
  * cheap pizza or Greek specialties ([Pamcial](https://g.co/kgs/65E9JQV)) nearby
  * bring something and eat outside
  * coffee and snacks are available at vending machines
