# Exams in Italy

* Exams can be retaken; the latest results counts – including fails!
* Oral exams might be done in front of an audience (other students).
* No normalization is applied to the grades.
  * Importantly, individual exams need to be passed: You can't just pass exam B with a good grade after you failed exam A to pass the overall module.
* As a concession, the professors directly involved with IMAPP might offer brief oral exams to increase the grades of those who barely failed (15–17/30) to the minimal passing grade (18/30).
