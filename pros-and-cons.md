# Pros & Cons

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is – by its nature – heavily opinionated. Take the following with a big grain of salt.
{% endhint %}

## General

* IMAPP is quite young. On one hand, this gives the professors (and, consequently, you) some freedom, on the other hand, organizational matters are usually tedious, procedures are unclear, and official communication is lacking at times.

## France

* [Accommodation](<France/Accommodation in France.md>) difficulty level: medium
* You are surrounded by a nice landscape
* Few people outside IMAPP speak English (and many aren't quite cooperative if you don't speak French)
* Few cities with active nightlife in the region
* Crowded canteen with hardly enjoyable, yet cheap food
  * Note: Another spot is currently being renovated, so it might be less crowded soon
* Long breaks (\~2 hours) between lectures without good spots to work
* Few places in the library have chargers or allow for collaborative work
* Some professors are difficult to work with; it often boils down to their idea of “respect”

## Germany

{% hint style="info" %}
This is written from a German's (obviously biased) perspective (for now).
{% endhint %}

* [Accommodation](<Germany/Accommodation in Germany.md>) difficulty level: easy
* More options for food that actually tastes okay, at comparable prices
* Being in the _Ruhrgebiet_ means you have many large cities and possibilities nearby – and public transport is included in your semester fee!
* Many people speak English; hardly anyone will judge you for not speaking German

## Italy

{% hint style="info" %}
This is based on what last year's students told us.

* [Accommodation](<Italy/Accommodation in Italy.md>) difficulty level: hard
* There is no single campus
