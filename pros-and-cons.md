# Pros & Cons

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is – by its nature – heavily opinionated. Take the following with a big grain of salt.
{% endhint %}

## France

* [Accommodation](<France/Accommodation in France.md>) difficulty level: medium
* You are surrounded by a nice landscape
* Few people outside IMAPP speak English (and many aren't quite cooperative if you don't speak French)
* Few cities with active nightlife in the region
* Crowded canteen with hardly enjoyable, yet cheap food
  * Note: Another spot is currently being renovated, so it might be less crowded soon
* Long breaks (\~2 hours) between lectures without good spots to work
* Few places in the library have chargers or allow for collaborative work

## Germany

{% hint style="info" %}
This is written from a German's (obviously biased) perspective (for now).
{% endhint %}

* [Accommodation](<Germany/Accommodation in Germany.md>) difficulty level: easy
* More options for food that actually tastes okay, at comparable prices
* Being in the _Ruhrgebiet_ means you have many large cities and possibilities nearby – and public transport is included in your semester fee!
* Many people speak English; nobody will judge you for not speaking German

## Italy

{% hint style="info" %}
This is based on what last year's students told us.
{% endhint %}

* [Accommodation](<Italy/Accommodation in Italy.md>) difficulty level: hard
* There is no single campus
