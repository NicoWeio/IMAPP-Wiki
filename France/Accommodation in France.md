# Accommodation in France

## CROUS

* [CROUS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre\_r%C3%A9gional\_des\_%C5%93uvres\_universitaires\_et\_scolaires) (_centres régionaux des œuvres universitaires et scolaires_) are regional organizations providing accommodation and student restaurants, among other services
* On [trouverunlogement.lescrous.fr](https://trouverunlogement.lescrous.fr/), one can apply for a student residence
* [This guide](https://www.crous-clermont.fr/etudes-internationales/se-loger-en-france/je-suis-etudiant-international-en-mobilite-individuelle-et-demande-un-logement-au-crous-clermont-auvergne/) details the necessary steps
* **However:** The application process has two phases, and as an international student, you can ([most likely](https://www.etudiant.gouv.fr/fr/logement-pour-les-etudiants-internationaux-193)) only apply during the second phase – this makes it unlikely for you to get a place
  * In 2023, _no_ accommodation was available at the start of the second phase
  * Only _once_, from August 26th–29th, there was _one_ room offered
* You might have better chances if you [contact CROUS Clermont](https://www.crous-clermont.fr/contacts/logement-et-vie-en-residence/) instead of relying on their website
* It has been tried to reserve CROUS accommodation for IMAPP students, but as of 2023, to no avail
* Other possibilities are outlined [here](https://www.crous-clermont.fr/etudes-internationales/se-loger-en-france/)
