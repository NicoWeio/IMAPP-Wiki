# Enrollment in France

{% hint style="info" %}
This was the procedure in 2023. It's likely to change.
{% endhint %}

* Sign a student agreement and fill out a long form (during the first official meeting)
* Wait a few days
* Go to the office inside the physics building and ask for your _Numéro de dossier_
  * You will need to show an ID/passport/…
  * If you enter the building from [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eHRUg6KiQFEF8nXu6), it's almost immediately to the left
  * Even if the door is closed, just go in
* Go to https://ent.uca.fr/compte/password/firstStudentConnexion and follow the instructions
* Upload a photo for your French student ID card
