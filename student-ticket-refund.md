# Student ticket refund

The semester ticket entitles you to use the German regional public transport.

Since you do not make use of the German student ticket while in France or Italy, you are eligible for a refund.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Once a refund is requested, the student ticket (for the current semester) is no longer valid.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The refund procedure is done _per semester_. So don't worry, you will have your student ticket during the Dortmund semester(s).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
This is proven to work in the winter semester 2023/24.

Deadline: March 15th, 2024
