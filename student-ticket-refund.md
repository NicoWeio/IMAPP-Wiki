# Student ticket refund

Since you do not make use of the German student ticket while in France or Italy, you are eligible for a refund.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Once a refund is requested, the student ticket (for the current semester) is no longer valid.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
This is proven to work in the winter semester 2023/24.

Deadline: March 15th, 2024
