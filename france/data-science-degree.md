# Data Science Degree

* With little additional work, you can get an additional degree in Data Science
  * You just need to take one extra course
* However, you will need to pay â‚¬390 (don't quote me on that) for enrollment
* There is (as of September 2023) still plenty of time to decide
* If you are convinced already, contact [Prof. Julien Donini](https://imapp.eu/teacher/prof-julien-donini/)
