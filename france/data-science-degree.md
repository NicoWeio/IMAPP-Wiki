* With little additional work, you can get an additional diploma in Data Science
* This is a [_Diplôme universitaire_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipl%C3%B4me\_universitaire), not a Bachelor/Master degree!
* You just need to take one extra course in _Deep Learning_
* However, you will need to pay 450 € for enrollment
* You should decide until around 17.11.
* Responsible: [Prof. Julien Donini](https://imapp.eu/teacher/prof-julien-donini/)
