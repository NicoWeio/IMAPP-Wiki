# Campus in France

* Where, precisely, will the lectures be?
  * Most will be in the [École Universitaire de Physique et d'Ingénierie (EUPI)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/es8xHWgyTcfjRTJg6)
    * You can enter the building on its [north](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9s5f8CinVaoQ9QiM7) and south side
* Where can I eat on campus?
  * On the way to the canteen, there is a food truck that offers solid baguettes
    * There, you don't need a student ID, which might be helpful at the beginning of the semester
  * The (lower) canteen
    * Payment via _Izly_ points
      * You should have received an e-mail with setup instructions for Izly
    * You need to buy ≥6 points worth of food, otherwise you can't even sit there
* What about power outlets?
  * The library's reading rooms (apart from the uppermost floor) don't have any, but there are a few “powerbanks” with 230 V and USB sockets
  * Regular lecture halls don't have any at your seat
