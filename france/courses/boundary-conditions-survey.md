# “Boundary conditions” survey

Here are the results from my survey on “boundary conditions” in the upcoming exams.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Machine Learning (Donini)" %}
* exam in question (to be certain, or if multiple): Machine Learning
* all exams from previous years that are intended to be shared have been shared already (yes/no; to be expected until): no, this is the 1st time that this exam is done on notebooks within a limited time.
* the exam will take (xx min): 1h30 - please note that the duration of all exams is indicated on the ENT.
* allowed aids ↓
  * lecture notes (yes/no): yes
    * including slides (if applicable; yes/no): yes
    * including handouts (if applicable; yes/no): yes
    * including excerpts of books/webpages/… (yes/no): no, except if stated otherwise
    * may be viewed on digital devices (yes/no): yes
    * exceptions (if any; such as specific exercises):
  * calculator (yes/no, needed / not needed): not needed in principle, since you will be working on a notebook

I should send instructions a few days before the exam takes place.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Deep Learning (Langevin) (DU only)" %}
* exam in question (to be certain, or if multiple): Deep Learning module of the DU Data Scientist
* all exams from previous years that are intended to be shared have been shared already (yes/no; to be expected until): None (there were no written exams the previous years)
* the exam will take (xx min): 90 min
* allowed aids ↓
  * lecture notes (yes/no): No
  * “cheat sheet” (if lecture notes are not allowed) ↓ No
  * calculator (yes/no, needed / not needed): Not needed
* additional remarks (if any): People asked me yesterday so: there won't be questions about algebra and/or coding by hand some parts of neural networks. The subject of the course is deep learning architectures and good practices, this is what the exam will be testing. ALSO, there's a short test (45 minutes, same conditions) on Thursday 02/01 at the beginning of class.
