# “Boundary conditions” survey

Here are the results from my survey on “boundary conditions” in the upcoming exams.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Machine Learning (Donini)" %}
* exam in question (to be certain, or if multiple): Machine Learning
* all exams from previous years that are intended to be shared have been shared already (yes/no; to be expected until): no, this is the 1st time that this exam is done on notebooks within a limited time.
* the exam will take (xx min): 1h30 - please note that the duration of all exams is indicated on the ENT.
* allowed aids ↓
  * lecture notes (yes/no): yes
    * including slides (if applicable; yes/no): yes
    * including handouts (if applicable; yes/no): yes
    * including excerpts of books/webpages/… (yes/no): no, except if stated otherwise
    * may be viewed on digital devices (yes/no): yes
    * exceptions (if any; such as specific exercises):
  * calculator (yes/no, needed / not needed): not needed in principle, since you will be working on a notebook

I should send instructions a few days before the exam takes place.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="EWK/Flavor/Neutrinos" %}
**General**

> In our three exams wrapped up as EWK, all documents are allowed but lectures notes and slides are the only recommended. This is to make sure that you are not getting drawned under too much documentation. Accordingly, cheat sheet can be as well prepared.

* You don't get all three exam sheets at once, but after each other.

**Neutrinos**

* allowed notes: nothing but what we wrote/got in class
* exam always contains two parts:
  * general knowledge questions (½ of the points; just answer; no computation)
    * example: What is the solar neutrino problem in one word?
  * exercises as done during the final lecture
    * If you made some error in the middle and the result looks fishy, just say so. "We are not here to test your trigonometry skills".
    * Usually, you have to discuss the result
  * bonus questions
* points per task are indicated in the exam

{% tab title="QFT (Morenas)" %}
* _not allowed_: the e⁺e⁻→µ⁺µ⁻ example from 2023-12-04
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Cosmology (Rosnet)" %}
* allowed to bring notes _on paper_ (including prints)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Neutrinos (Teixeira)" %}
* allowed aids ↓
  * lecture notes (yes/no):
    * including slides (if applicable; yes/no): yes
    * including handouts (if applicable; yes/no):
    * including excerpts of books/webpages/… (yes/no): yes?
    * may be viewed on digital devices (yes/no): yes; without internet connection
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Deep Learning (Langevin) (DU only)" %}
* exam in question (to be certain, or if multiple): Deep Learning module of the DU Data Scientist
* all exams from previous years that are intended to be shared have been shared already (yes/no; to be expected until): None (there were no written exams the previous years)
* the exam will take (xx min): 90 min
* allowed aids ↓
  * lecture notes (yes/no): No
  * “cheat sheet” (if lecture notes are not allowed) ↓ No
  * calculator (yes/no, needed / not needed): Not needed
* additional remarks (if any): People asked me yesterday so: there won't be questions about algebra and/or coding by hand some parts of neural networks. The subject of the course is deep learning architectures and good practices, this is what the exam will be testing. ALSO, there's a short test (45 minutes, same conditions) on Thursday 02/01 at the beginning of class.
