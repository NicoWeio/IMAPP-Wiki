# Exams in France

## Overview

Instead of a big table of mostly similar requirements, below is an overview highlighting the key differences:

* Homework/projects that account for 30% of the grade:
  * Statistics, Data Mining: mandatory; after the week with lectures and exercise sessions
  * Neutrino Physics: optional; overlaps with the big exam phase
* Allowed aids:
  * “the default”:
    * Lecture materials (analog+digital)
      * Interpretations of what counts as lecture material vary a lot.
      * Possibly with specific exceptions, such as electron scattering, Z decay, …
    * Calculator (hardly needed)
    * Possibly the PDG (booklet or [online](https://pdglive.lbl.gov/))
  * Quark-Gluon-Plasma, Data Mining, [_Deep Learning_](../data-science-degree.md): no aids at all
  * Symmetries, Cosmology: analog lecture materials only
  * Python, Machine Learning (on a PC): Documentation inside the IDE and online; possibly Jupyter notebooks from the exercise sessions

## FAQ

* Do I need to bring anything?
  * Nothing but your notes (if allowed), a pen, and (though not always checked) your student ID card
  * Blank paper will be provided
* On what scale will I be graded?
  * The French scale ranges from 0 (worst) to 20 (best).
  * **You pass if your average on all the semester's exams is ≥10 points.**
* Are there any exams from previous semesters for practicing?
  * Yes, usually: Ask the professors and look at the courses' Moodle pages
  * There is also an online collection [about here](https://nicoweio.github.io/IMAPP-Exams/). In order to protect the intellectual property, I can't share the actual address publicly.
* (How) are grades normalized?
  * At the end of the semester, there will be a conference of all teaching staff where the grades can be shifted, apparently without adhering to specific rules.

## Structuring of modules and weighting of courses

{% hint style="info" %}
The _UCA seminar on particle physics_ is not listed in the _releve de notes_, since it is not graded, but its 3 CP do count.
