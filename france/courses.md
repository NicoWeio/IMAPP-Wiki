## FAQ

* Do I need to bring anything?
  * Nothing but your notes and a pen: no student ID card, no paper
* On what scale will I be graded?
  * The French scale ranges from 0 (worst) to 20 (best).
  * You pass if your average on all the semester's exams is ≥10 points.
* Are there any exams from previous semesters for practicing?
  * Yes, usually: Ask the professors and look at the courses' Moodle pages
  * There is also an online collection [about here](https://nicoweio.github.io/IMAPP-Exams/). In order to protect the intellectual property, I can't share the actual address.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The following questions are not fully resolved yet:

* (How) are grades normalized?
  * At the end of the semester, there will be a conference of all teaching staff where the grades can be shifted, apparently without adhering to specific rules.
