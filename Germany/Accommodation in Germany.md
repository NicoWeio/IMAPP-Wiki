# Accommodation in Germany

* The _Studierendenwerk Dortmund_ reserves accommodation for foreign students; this has actually worked in the past
* The reserved capacity should be enough for most or all IMAPP students. Non-EU students might be prioritized.
* You'll get an offer for one of [many residences](https://www.stwdo.de/wohnen/alle-wohnanlagen)
  * Don't be afraid if your residence is not right next to the North campus: You can use buses or the [H-Bahn](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-Bahn), for free
* For some reason, a cleaning service is included with your contract â€“ don't be surprised if they enter without warning!
